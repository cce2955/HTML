This is a git repo to host a html project I'm working on, it's a mishmash of things I've made in C++ converted to javascript and original projects I've created just to show off. When this directory is downloaded everything should be referenced correctly to just work on your commputer, if not, I may attempt to get a FTP server and host it if needed

As of now it loads into a main page utilizing bootstrap with parallax scrolling. It links to 3 projects I have done


A. A simple calculator that determines armstrong numbers with a limit between 100 and 999. - Done

B. A canvas project that iterates a tree. - WIP

C. A neural network that determines which celebrity personality it comes from, the base library was provided from an outside source but has been modified by me and I have an understanding of what it entails.

~~D. Me figuring out formatting how formatting works in markdown~~
