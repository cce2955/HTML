This is a git repo to host a html project I'm working on, it's a mishmash of things I've made in C++ converted to javascript and original projects I've created just to show off. When this directory is downloaded everything should be referenced correctly to just work on your commputer, if not, I may attempt to get a FTP server and host it if needed
